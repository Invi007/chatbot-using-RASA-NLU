-The Chatbot will answer questions such as : ”How will an admission process should be
carried out ?”. It will also answer the general queries of locating classrooms, canteen,
college office, SFC office, college Gym etc.
-It also will provide with correct and proper information about the names office and
coordinators of each stream.
-It will also provide information about the events, holidays and guest lectures.
Previously the visitors used to disturb college staff for the queries, so this would be
reduced after implementation of Chatbot.
